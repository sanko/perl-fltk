=head1 NAME

FLTK::LightButton - A subclass of C<FLTK::CheckButton>

=head1 Description

This button turns the L<C<value( )>|FLTK::Button> on and off each release
of a click inside of it, and displays a light to show the user this. This
style was designed for the original Forms library and has been copied
into Discreet products and many other pieces of software that originated
with SGI machines.

When off the light is L<C<color( )>|FLTK::Widget/color ( )>, when on the
light is L<C<selection_color( )>|FLTK::Widget/selection_color ( )>.

=head1 Constructor

This class supports only one basic constructor.

=over

=item C<new ( x, y, w, h, [label = ''] )>

The default constructor takes a value for x(), y(), w(), and h(), and an
optional value for label(). All subclasses must provide an identical
constructor in order to work with Fluid. They may also provide
alternative constructors.

If L<C<FLTK::Group::begin( )>|FLTK::Group/"begin ( )"> has been called,
this widget is added as a new child of that group, and parent() is set to
the group. If L<C<FLTK::Group::begin( )>|FLTK::Group/"begin ( )"> has not
been called, or L<C<FLTK::Group::end( )>|FLTK::Group/"end ( )"> has been
called, or L<C<FLTK::Group::current( 0 )>|FLTK::Group/"current ( )">,
then the parent() is set to C<undef>. In this case you must add the
widget yourself in order to see it.
