=head1 NAME

FLTK::HighlightButton - A subclass of C<FLTK::Button>

=head1 Description

Same as a L<normal button|FLTK::Button> but the C<box( )> defaults to a
style that draws as a flat rectangle until the mouse points at it, then
it draws as a raised highlighted rectangle.

=head1 Constructor

This class supports only one basic constructor.

=over

=item C<new ( x, y, w, h, [label = ''] )>

The default constructor takes a value for x(), y(), w(), and h(), and an
optional value for label(). All subclasses must provide an identical
constructor in order to work with Fluid. They may also provide
alternative constructors.

If L<C<FLTK::Group::begin( )>|FLTK::Group/"begin ( )"> has been called,
this widget is added as a new child of that group, and parent() is set to
the group. If L<C<FLTK::Group::begin( )>|FLTK::Group/"begin ( )"> has not
been called, or L<C<FLTK::Group::end( )>|FLTK::Group/"end ( )"> has been
called, or L<C<FLTK::Group::current( 0 )>|FLTK::Group/"current ( )">,
then the parent() is set to C<undef>. In this case you must add the
widget yourself in order to see it.
