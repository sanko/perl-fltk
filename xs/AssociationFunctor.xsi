FLTK::AssociationFunctor -

=head1 Description

Class used by the L<foreach()|FLTK::AssociationType/"foreach"> functions. Base
class for the association functor that is used in
L<foreach()|FLTK::AssociationType/"foreach">. If you want to supply your
specific actions to do with the associated data found by the
L<foreach()|FLTK::AssociationType/"foreach"> functions you need to derive from
this class and provide a new handle function.

=begin apidoc

=for apidoc xH||bool|handle|at|widget|coderef

For each found association this function is called. If the function returns
true the loop is aborted and the data pointer for the current association is
returned.
