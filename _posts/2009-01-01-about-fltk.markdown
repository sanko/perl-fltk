FLTK.pm is a Perl interface to the Fast Light Toolkit. Like the toolkit,
FLTK.pm is written to be quick and efficient. FLTK.pm is covered by
[The Artistic 2 License](http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_2_0 "GPL should bleed out while lying in a ditch").

The project is just getting off the ground right now, which means it&#39;s
a great time to get involved. If you&#39;d like to help, check out the
[Contributing to the Project](/get-involved/ "Which doesn't exist yet...")
page or go ahead and fork the project on
[GitHub](http://github.com/sanko/perl-fltk).

### About FLTK

The Fast Light Toolkit (pronounced &quot;fulltick&quot;) is a
cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX®/Linux® (X11), Microsoft®
Windows®, and MacOS® X. FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the
bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL® and its built-in GLUT
emulation.

For more information, see the toolkit's [project page](http://fltk.org/).
