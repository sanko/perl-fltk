NAME
    FLTK::Version - FLTK's project-wide version numbers

Description
    Because of the problems coordinating revision numbers in a distributed
    version control system and across a directory full of Perl modules, this
    module provides a central location for the project's overall release
    number.

Versioning Specification
    This module is based on the experimental 2.0.x branch of the Feather
    Light Tool Kit. Our version numbers are generated to reflect the SVN
    revision of the bundled FLTK source. These will most likely be the most
    recent weekly checkouts.

    The distribution's name is taken from FLTK's version number. For
    example, a distribution bundled and built on FLTK "r6543" would look
    look like "FLTK-0.6543.tar.gz" and the distribution's version would
    obviously be 0.6543. When present, the three minor digits will represent
    how stable I deem my module:

     _0xx may lead to sterility
     _1xx is risky business
     _2xx is pretty stable
     _3xx is slightly less stable
     _4xx is solid
     _5xx is stable enough
     _6xx is without a doubt really stable
     _7xx may contain new code for the next .0 release, so it's less stable
     _8xx probably contains new, stable code for the next .0 release
     _9xx uploaded only to get tester data before the next .0 release

    Even numbers should be fairly stable so unless you enjoy broken software
    stick with those.
