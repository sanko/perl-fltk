Description
    FLTK is-

    This project has a long way to go so I am seeking volunteers to help
    with testing and development.

    Please see the TODO list and the notes on getting started.

    Ahem. FLTK is a graphical user interface toolkit for X (UNIX速),
    Microsoft速 Windows速, OS/X, and several other platforms. FLTK provides
    modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via
    OpenGL速 and its built-in GLUT emulation.

Synopsis
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use FLTK;

        my $window = FLTK::Window->new(300, 180);
        $window->begin();
        my $box = FLTK::Widget->new(20, 40, 260, 100, "Hello, World!");
        $box->box(UP_BOX);
        $box->labelfont(HELVETICA_BOLD_ITALIC);
        $box->labelsize(36);
        $box->labeltype(SHADOW_LABEL);
        $window->end();
        $window->show();
        exit run();
