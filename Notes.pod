=head1 NAME

FLTK::Notes - Annotated Guide to the Ins and Outs of FLTK

=head1 Description

This is a first draft attempt at defining a road map for future C<FLTK>
development and a behavioral reference for users and third-party developers.

=head1 Class Hierarchy

TODO

=head1 Installation

This distribution uses C<Module::Build> for installation, so use the following
procedure:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

See also: L<Automated Test Reports|/"Automated Test Reports">

=head2 Prerequisites

C<FLTK> requires L<Alien::FLTK|Alien::FLTK> which is listed as prerequisite in
Build.PL so, unless you answer 'no' when prompted, the CPAN shell should
automagically install it for you.

=head1 How Do I...

Parts that aren't handled internally are described here (eventually) with
sample code to get you started.

TODO

=head1 FLTK Internals

This section describes all the behind the scenes stuff that makes C<FLTK>
work.  Or not work.  It depends.

=head2 FLTK Libraries

Please refer to L<Alien::FLTK|Alien::FLTK>.

=head2 Customizing the Build Process

=for notes This is where I'll describe stuff like how to turn on/off various
flags during compilation

TODO

=head2 Depricated Widgets and Functions

TODO

=head2 Compatibility Notes

This section lists recent major changes in API or behavior between stable
releases.  For older news see the F<Changes> file included with this
distribution.  For detail see the commit logs.

=over

=item NA

I have not yet made a stable release at this time.

=back

=head1 Giving back

If you're interested in assisting with L<FLTK|FLTK>'s development but don't
know where to begin, here are a few ideas.

=head2 Joining the Project

C<FLTK> is too large for just one person to hack on.  If you're XS-, C++-, or
just Perl-adept and would like to help, you can start by forking the project
on github: http://github.com/sanko/fltk-perl/.  When ready, send me a pull
request, I'll look over your changes and get back to you. Minor patches get
your name in the changelog.  Major patches get your name in the
L<Acknowledgments|FLTK/Acknowledgments> section and an invitation to be a
trusted collaborator.  Oooo.  Ahhh.

=head2 Bug Reporting

Found bugs should be reported through C<FLTK>'s
L<Issue Tracker|/"Issue Tracker">.  Before creating a new report, please
review the following list:

=over

=item 1.

Make sure you are using the most recent stable release.

=item 2.

Make sure the bug is reproducible.

=item 3.

Please write in clear English.

=item 4.

Provide "baby steps" to describe exactly how to replicate the bug.  Sample
code is welcome.

=item 5.

Search the list of open and resolved issues to make sure the flaw hasn't
already been reported.  If it has, star the issue to stay up to date.

=item 6.

One bug is one bug report.  Please do not include multiple, separate issues in
one report unless they are explicitly related to each other.

=item 7.

Look over your report before submission to be sure you've included as much
detail as possible.  Seriously.  Get up, have a drink of water, come back,
read over it again to make sure you've included everything you intended, and
then submit it.

=head2 Automated Test Reports

Becoming a CPAN Tester is an easy, automatic way to contribute to the quality
of your favorite module and CPAN in general.  If you would like to contribute
automated test reports for C<FLTK>, install C<CPAN::Reporter> from the CPAN
shell first:

 $ cpan
 cpan> install CPAN::Reporter
 cpan> reload cpan
 cpan> o conf init test_report
   [...follow the CPAN::Reporter setup prompts...]
 cpan> o conf commit
 cpan> install Net::BitTorrent

For more on becoming a CPAN Tester and why this is useful, see the
L<CPAN::Reporter|CPAN::Reporter/"DESCRIPTION"> documentation and
http://cpantesters.org/.
